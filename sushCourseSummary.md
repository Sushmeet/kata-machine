# Sush Course Summary

Brief summary of The Primeagen's algorithms practice (day-by-day highlights).

-   **Course:** The Primeagen — Algorithms practice (part 1)
-   **Focus areas:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (BFS/DFS), Graphs, Heaps, Tries, Sorting (Quick, Merge, Bubble, Insertion), Searching (Linear, Binary), Maps, LRU, Maze solving, and basic dynamic problem-solving patterns.
-   **Practice tips:** Solve small kata daily, write tests, and trace pointer/index movement on paper for tricky pointer problems.

## Useful commands

-   Open in VS Code and use the built-in preview: `View → Open Preview` or `Cmd+K V` (macOS).
-   Serve locally to preview rendered files in your browser: `npx serve .` then open the served URL.

## Notes

-   This repository contains many example implementations and tests under `src/` and `src/__tests__/`.
-   Push to GitHub to view rendered `.md` files directly on the repository web UI.

### Big O Time Complexity 
- Here I talk about Big O
- When someone says your algorithm is O(n) that means your algo will grow linearly
  - An example of this can be a for loop which traverses all n integers in an array.
